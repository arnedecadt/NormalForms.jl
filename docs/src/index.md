# NormalForms

This package provides functions for calculating the Hermite normal form (`hnfr!()`, `hnfr()`, 
`hnfc!()`, `hnfc()`), and the Smith normal form (`snf!()`, `snf!()`), as well as factorization
types `RowHermite`, `ColumnHermite`, and `Smith`, which are subtypes of
`LinearAlgebra.Factorization`.
